Main Features \u00b6 Simple : Pypeln was designed to solve medium data tasks that require parallelism and concurrency where using frameworks like Spark or Dask feels exaggerated or unnatural. Easy-to-use : Pypeln exposes a familiar functional API compatible with regular Python code. Flexible : Pypeln enables you to build pipelines using Processes, Threads and asyncio.Tasks via the exact same API. Fine-grained Control : Pypeln allows you to have control over the memory and cpu resources used at each stage of your pipelines. For more information take a look at the Documentation . Installation \u00b6 Install Pypeln using pip: pip install pypeln Basic Usage \u00b6 With Pypeln you can easily create multi-stage data pipelines using 3 type of workers: Processes \u00b6 You can create a pipeline based on multiprocessing.Process workers by using the process module: import pypeln as pl import time from random import random def slow_add1 ( x ): time . sleep ( random ()) # <= some slow computation return x + 1 def slow_gt3 ( x ): time . sleep ( random ()) # <= some slow computation return x > 3 data = range ( 10 ) # [0, 1, 2, ..., 9] stage = pl . process . map ( slow_add1 , data , workers = 3 , maxsize = 4 ) stage = pl . process . filter ( slow_gt3 , stage , workers = 2 ) data = list ( stage ) # e.g. [5, 6, 9, 4, 8, 10, 7] At each stage the you can specify the numbers of workers . The maxsize parameter limits the maximum amount of elements that the stage can hold simultaneously. Threads \u00b6 You can create a pipeline based on threading.Thread workers by using the thread module: import pypeln as pl import time from random import random def slow_add1 ( x ): time . sleep ( random ()) # <= some slow computation return x + 1 def slow_gt3 ( x ): time . sleep ( random ()) # <= some slow computation return x > 3 data = range ( 10 ) # [0, 1, 2, ..., 9] stage = pl . thread . map ( slow_add1 , data , workers = 3 , maxsize = 4 ) stage = pl . thread . filter ( slow_gt3 , stage , workers = 2 ) data = list ( stage ) # e.g. [5, 6, 9, 4, 8, 10, 7] Here we have the exact same situation as in the previous case except that the worker are Threads. Tasks \u00b6 You can create a pipeline based on asyncio.Task workers by using the task module: import pypeln as pl import asyncio from random import random async def slow_add1 ( x ): await asyncio . sleep ( random ()) # <= some slow computation return x + 1 async def slow_gt3 ( x ): await asyncio . sleep ( random ()) # <= some slow computation return x > 3 data = range ( 10 ) # [0, 1, 2, ..., 9] stage = pl . task . map ( slow_add1 , data , workers = 3 , maxsize = 4 ) stage = pl . task . filter ( slow_gt3 , stage , workers = 2 ) data = list ( stage ) # e.g. [5, 6, 9, 4, 8, 10, 7] Conceptually similar but everything is running in a single thread and Task workers are created dynamically. Mixed Pipelines \u00b6 You can create pipelines using different worker types such that each type is the best for its given task so you can get the maximum performance out of your code: data = get_iterable () data = pl . task . map ( f1 , data , workers = 100 ) data = pl . thread . flat_map ( f2 , data , workers = 10 ) data = filter ( f3 , data ) data = pl . process . map ( f4 , data , workers = 5 , maxsize = 200 ) Notice that here we even used a regular python filter , since stages are iterables Pypeln integrates smoothly with any python code, just be aware of how each stage behaves. Pipe Operator \u00b6 In the spirit of being a true pipeline library, Pypeln also lets you create your pipelines using the pipe | operator: data = ( range ( 10 ) | pl . process . map ( slow_add1 , workers = 3 , maxsize = 4 ) | pl . process . filter ( slow_gt3 , workers = 2 ) | list ) Benchmarks \u00b6 Making an Unlimited Number of Requests with Python aiohttp + pypeln Code Related Stuff \u00b6 mpipe Process Pools Making 100 million requests with Python aiohttp Python multiprocessing Queue memory management Contributors \u00b6 cgarciae License \u00b6 MIT","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#pypeln","text":"Pypeln (pronounced as \"pypeline\") is a simple yet powerful python library for creating concurrent data pipelines.","title":"Pypeln"},{"location":"#main-features","text":"Simple : Pypeln was designed to solve medium data tasks that require parallelism and concurrency where using frameworks like Spark or Dask feels exaggerated or unnatural.

Related stages are connected by a queue , workers from one stage put items into it, and workers from the other stage get items from it. Source stages consume iterables. Sink stages can be converted into iterables which consume them. Stage Types \u00b6 Pypeln has 3 types of stages, each stage has an associated worker and queue types: Stage Type Worker Queue pl.process.Stage multiprocessing.Process multiprocessing.Queue pl.thread.Stage threading.Thread queue.Queue pl.task.Stage asyncio.Task asyncio.Queue Depending on the type of stage you use the following characteristics will vary: memory management, concurrency, parallelism, inter-stage communication overhead, worker initialization overhead: Stage Type Memory Concurrency Parallelism Communication Overhead Initialization Overhead process independent cpu + IO cpu + IO high high thread shared only for IO only for IO none mid task shared optimized IO optimized IO none low Stages \u00b6 Stages are lazy iterable objects that only contain meta information about the computation, to actually execute a pipeline you can iterate over it using a for loop, calling list , pl.<module>.run , etc. For example: import pypeln as pl import time from random import random def slow_add1 ( x ): time . sleep ( random ()) # <= some slow computation return x + 1 data = range ( 10 ) # [0, 1, 2, ..., 9] stage = pl . process . map ( slow_add1 , data , workers = 3 , maxsize = 4 ) for x in stage : print ( x ) # e.g. 2, 1, 5, 6, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 This example uses pl.process but it works the same for all the other modules. Since pypeln implements the Iterable interface it becomes very intuitive to use and compatible with most other python code. Workers \u00b6 Warning This section is not yet ported correctly Each Stage defines a number of workers The number of workers on each stage can usually be controled by the workers parameter on pypeln 's various functions. Try not to create more processes than the number of cores you have on your machine or else they will end up fighting for resources and computation will be suboptimal. The worker type of this module is a multiprocessing.Process . Each worker process is instantiated with daemon = True . Creating each process is slow and consumes a lot of memory. Since processes are technically separate programs managed by the OS they are great for doing operations in parallel by avoiding the GIL (or rather having their separate GIL). Queues \u00b6 Warning This section is not yet ported correctly The queue type of this module is a multiprocessing.Queue . Since processes don't share memory, all information passed between them through these queues must first be serialized (pickled) which is slow, be aware of this and try to avoid sending large objects. The number of elements each stage can hold usually be controled by the maxsize parameter on pypeln.process 's various functions. When passed this parameter sets a maximum size for the input Queue of the stage, this serves as a backpressure mechanism because any stages pushing data to a Queue that becomes full (reaches its maxsize ) will have to stop their computation until space becomes available, thus, potentially preveting OutOfMemeory errors due to overpressure from faster stages. Resource Management \u00b6 Warning This section is not yet ported correctly There are many occasions where you need to create some resource objects (e.g. http or database sessions) that for efficiency are expected to last the whole lifespan of each worker. To handle such objects many functions have the on_start and on_done arguments which expect some callback functions. When a worker is created it calls the on_start function, this functions should create and return the resource objects. These object will be passed as extra arguments to the main function and also to the on_end function. import pypeln as pl def (): http_session = get_http_session () db_session = get_db_session () return http_session , db_session def on_end ( _stage_status , http_session , db_session ): http_session . close () db_session . close () def f ( x , http_session , db_session ): # some logic return y stage = pl . process . map ( f , stage , workers = 3 , on_start = on_start ) A few notes: The resource objects are created per worker. on_start should return a object other that None or a tuple of resource objects. If on_start returns some arguments then they must be accepted by f and on_end . on_end receives a pypeln.process.StageStatus object followed by the resource objects created by on_start . Pipe Operator \u00b6 Warning This section is not yet ported correctly Functions that accept a stage parameter return a Partial instead of a new stage when stage is not given. These Partial s are callables that accept the missing stage parameter and return the full output of the original function. For example pl.process.map(f, stage, **kwargs) = pl.process.map(f, **kwargs)(stage) The important thing about partials is that they implement the pipe | operator as x | partial = partial(x) This allows you to define pipelines in the following way: from pypenl import process as pr data = ( range(10) | pl.process.map(slow_add1, workers = 3, maxsize = 4) | pl.process.filter(slow_gt3, workers = 2) | list ) Recomendations \u00b6 Warning This section is not yet ported correctly Creating processes and doing Inter-Process Communication (IPC) is expensive, therefore we recommend the following: Minimize the number of stages based on this module. Tune the number of workers based on the number of cores. When processing large datasets set the maxsize of the stage to prevent OutOfMemory errors. If possible don't send large objects. If you just need a single stage to perform a task over a collection in parallel use the pypeln.process.each function.
