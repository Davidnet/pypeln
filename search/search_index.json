Main Features \u00b6 Simple : Pypeln was designed to solve medium data tasks that require parallelism and concurrency where using frameworks like Spark or Dask feels exaggerated or unnatural. Easy-to-use : Pypeln exposes a familiar functional API compatible with regular Python code. Flexible : Pypeln enables you to build pipelines using Processes, Threads and asyncio.Tasks via the exact same API. Fine-grained Control : Pypeln allows you to have control over the memory and cpu resources used at each stage of your pipelines. For more information take a look at the Documentation . Installation \u00b6 Install Pypeln using pip: pip install pypeln Basic Usage \u00b6 With Pypeln you can easily create multi-stage data pipelines using 3 type of workers: Processes \u00b6 You can create a pipeline based on multiprocessing.Process workers by using the process module: import pypeln as pl import time from random import random def slow_add1 ( x ): time . sleep ( random ()) # <= some slow computation return x + 1 def slow_gt3 ( x ): time . sleep ( random ()) # <= some slow computation return x > 3 data = range ( 10 ) # [0, 1, 2, ..., 9] stage = pl . process . map ( slow_add1 , data , workers = 3 , maxsize = 4 ) stage = pl . process . filter ( slow_gt3 , stage , workers = 2 ) data = list ( stage ) # e.g. [5, 6, 9, 4, 8, 10, 7] At each stage the you can specify the numbers of workers . The maxsize parameter limits the maximum amount of elements that the stage can hold simultaneously. Threads \u00b6 You can create a pipeline based on threading.Thread workers by using the thread module: import pypeln as pl import time from random import random def slow_add1 ( x ): time . sleep ( random ()) # <= some slow computation return x + 1 def slow_gt3 ( x ): time . sleep ( random ()) # <= some slow computation return x > 3 data = range ( 10 ) # [0, 1, 2, ..., 9] stage = pl . thread . map ( slow_add1 , data , workers = 3 , maxsize = 4 ) stage = pl . thread . filter ( slow_gt3 , stage , workers = 2 ) data = list ( stage ) # e.g. [5, 6, 9, 4, 8, 10, 7] Here we have the exact same situation as in the previous case except that the worker are Threads. Tasks \u00b6 You can create a pipeline based on asyncio.Task workers by using the task module: import pypeln as pl import asyncio from random import random async def slow_add1 ( x ): await asyncio . sleep ( random ()) # <= some slow computation return x + 1 async def slow_gt3 ( x ): await asyncio . sleep ( random ()) # <= some slow computation return x > 3 data = range ( 10 ) # [0, 1, 2, ..., 9] stage = pl . task . map ( slow_add1 , data , workers = 3 , maxsize = 4 ) stage = pl . task . filter ( slow_gt3 , stage , workers = 2 ) data = list ( stage ) # e.g. [5, 6, 9, 4, 8, 10, 7] Conceptually similar but everything is running in a single thread and Task workers are created dynamically. Mixed Pipelines \u00b6 You can create pipelines using different worker types such that each type is the best for its given task so you can get the maximum performance out of your code: data = get_iterable () data = pl . task . map ( f1 , data , workers = 100 ) data = pl . thread . flat_map ( f2 , data , workers = 10 ) data = filter ( f3 , data ) data = pl . process . map ( f4 , data , workers = 5 , maxsize = 200 ) Notice that here we even used a regular python filter , since stages are iterables Pypeln integrates smoothly with any python code, just be aware of how each stage behaves. Pipe Operator \u00b6 In the spirit of being a true pipeline library, Pypeln also lets you create your pipelines using the pipe | operator: data = ( range ( 10 ) | pl . process . map ( slow_add1 , workers = 3 , maxsize = 4 ) | pl . process . filter ( slow_gt3 , workers = 2 ) | list ) Related Stuff \u00b6 Making an Unlimited Number of Requests with Python aiohttp + pypeln Process Pools Making 100 million requests with Python aiohttp Python multiprocessing Queue memory management joblib mpipe Contributors \u00b6 cgarciae License \u00b6 MIT","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#pypeln","text":"Pypeln (pronounced as \"pypeline\") is a simple yet powerful Python library for creating concurrent data pipelines.","title":"Pypeln"},{"location":"#main-features","text":"Simple : Pypeln was designed to solve medium data tasks that require parallelism and concurrency where using frameworks like Spark or Dask feels exaggerated or unnatural.

Related stages are connected by a queue , workers from one stage put items into it, and workers from the other stage get items from it. Source stages consume iterables. Sink stages can be converted into iterables which consume them. Stage Types \u00b6 Pypeln has 3 types of stages, each stage has an associated worker and queue types: Stage Type Worker Queue pl.process.Stage multiprocessing.Process multiprocessing.Queue pl.thread.Stage threading.Thread queue.Queue pl.task.Stage asyncio.Task asyncio.Queue Depending on the type of stage you use the following characteristics will vary: memory management, concurrency, parallelism, inter-stage communication overhead, worker initialization overhead: Stage Type Memory Concurrency Parallelism Communication Overhead Initialization Overhead process independent cpu + IO cpu + IO high high thread shared only for IO only for IO none mid task shared optimized IO optimized IO none low Stages \u00b6 Stages are lazy iterable objects that only contain meta information about the computation, to actually execute a pipeline you can iterate over it using a for loop, calling list , pl.<module>.run , etc. For example: import pypeln as pl import time from random import random def slow_add1 ( x ): time . sleep ( random ()) # <= some slow computation return x + 1 data = range ( 10 ) # [0, 1, 2, ..., 9] stage = pl . process . map ( slow_add1 , data , workers = 3 , maxsize = 4 ) for x in stage : print ( x ) # e.g. 2, 1, 5, 6, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 This example uses pl.process but it works the same for all the other modules. Since pypeln implements the Iterable interface it becomes very intuitive to use and compatible with most other python code. Workers \u00b6 Each Stage defines a number of workers which can usually be controlled by the workers parameter on pypeln 's various functions. In general try not to create more workers than the number of cores you have on your machine or else they will end up fighting for resources, but this varies with the type of worker. The following table shows the relative cost in memory + cpu usage of creating each worker: Worker Memory + CPU Cost Process high Thread mid Task low General guidelines: Only use processes when you need to perform heavy CPU operations in pararallel such as image processing, data transformations, etc. When forking a Process all the memory is copied to the new process, intialization is slow, communications between processes is costly since python objects have to be serialized, but you effectly escape the GIL so you gain true parallelism. Threads are very good for doing syncronous IO tasks such as interacting with the OS and libraries that yet don't expose a async API. Tasks are highly optimized for asynchronous IO operations, they are super cheap to create since they are just regular python objects, and you can generally create them in higher quantities since the event loop manages them efficiently for you. Queues \u00b6 Worker communicate between each other through Queues . The maximum number of elements each Queue can hold is controlled by the maxsize parameter in pypeln 's various functions. By default this number is 0 which means there is no limit to the number of elements, however when maxsize is set it serves as a backpressure mechanism that prevents previous stages from pushing new elements to a Queue when it becomes full (reaches its maxsize ), these stages will stop their computation until space becomes available thus potentially preveting OutOfMemeory errors on the slower stages. The following table shows the relative communication cost between workers given the nature of their queues: Worker Communication Cost Process high Thread none Task none General guidelines: Communication between processes is costly since python objects have to be serialized, which has a considerable overhead when passing large objects such as numpy arrays, binary objects, etc. To avoid this overhead try only passing metadata information such as filepaths between processes. There is no overhead in communication between threads or tasks , since everything happens in-memory there is no serialization overhead. Resource Management \u00b6 There are many occasions where you need to create some resource objects (e.g. http or database sessions) that (for efficiency) are expected to last the whole span of each worker's life. To support and effectily manage the lifecycle of such objects most of pypeln s functions accept the on_start and on_done callbacks. When a worker is created its on_start function get called. This function can return a dictionary containing these resource objects which will be passed as keyword arguments to the workers main function and the on_end function. For exmaple: import pypeln as pl def on_start (): return dict ( http_session = get_http_session (), db_session = get_db_session (), ) def f ( x , http_session , db_session ): # some logic return y def on_end ( http_session , db_session ): http_session . close () db_session . close () stage = pl . process . map ( f , stage , workers = 3 , on_start = on_start , on_end = on_end ) Additionally: If f defines a worker_info argument an object with information about the worker will be passed. If on_end defines a stage_status an object with information about the stage will be passed. Asyncio Integration \u00b6 While you can consume task stages synchronously as you've seen, there are 2 ways to consume them using python async syntax: await \u00b6 You can call await con any task.Stage to get back the results of its computation: import pypeln as pl import asyncio from random import random async def slow_add1 ( x ): await asyncio . sleep ( random ()) # <= some slow computation return x + 1 async def slow_gt3 ( x ): await asyncio . sleep ( random ()) # <= some slow computation return x > 3 async def main () data = range ( 10 ) # [0, 1, 2, ..., 9] stage = pl . task . map ( slow_add1 , data , workers = 3 , maxsize = 4 ) stage = pl . task . filter ( slow_gt3 , stage , workers = 2 ) data = await stage # e.g. [5, 6, 9, 4, 8, 10, 7] When calling await on a stage you will get back the same result if you called list on it with be big difference that you wont block the current thread while waiting for the computation to materialize. Note In this example you are responsible for running the main task in the event loop yourself. async for \u00b6 task Stages are asynchronous generators so you can iterate through them using async for to get access each new element as soon as it become available: import pypeln as pl import asyncio from random import random async def slow_add1 ( x ): await asyncio . sleep ( random ()) # <= some slow computation return x + 1 async def slow_gt3 ( x ): await asyncio . sleep ( random ()) # <= some slow computation return x > 3 async def main () data = range ( 10 ) # [0, 1, 2, ..., 9] stage = pl . task . map ( slow_add1 , data , workers = 3 , maxsize = 4 ) stage = pl . task . filter ( slow_gt3 , stage , workers = 2 ) async for element in stage : pritn ( element ) # 5 6 9 4 8 10 7 When iterating a stage using async for you will get back the same result as if you called the normal for on it with be big difference that you wont block the current thread while waiting for the next element. Note In this example you are responsible for running the main task in the event loop yourself. Event Loop \u00b6 When you run a task stage synchronously the tasks run on pypeln 's own event loop, however, if you itegrate them with other async code via await or async for these tasks will run on the current loop defined by asyncio.get_event_loop() . Pipe Operator \u00b6 Most functions can return a Partial instead of a Stage if the stage argument is not given. These Partial s are callables that accept the missing stage parameter and call the computation. The following expressions are equivalent: pl.process.map(f, stage, **kwargs) <=> pl.process.map(f, **kwargs)(stage) Partial implements the pipe | operator as x | partial <=> partial(x) This allows pypeln to enable you to define your pipelines more fluently: from pypenl import process as pr data = ( range ( 10 ) | pl . process . map ( slow_add1 , workers = 3 , maxsize = 4 ) | pl . process . filter ( slow_gt3 , workers = 2 ) | list )","title":"Advanced Usage"},{"location":"advanced/#advanced-usage","text":"","title":"Advanced Usage"},{"location":"advanced/#architecture","text":"A Pypeln pipeline has the following structure: Its composed of several concurrent stages At each stage it contains on or more worker entities that perform a task.
